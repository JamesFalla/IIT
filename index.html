					<p> As a kid my parents were big on sports, going outside, we didn't have internet until I was 13 when I needed it for High School. When I was 17 my parents bought me a laptop I could use for school, and of course at that age I bought a video game "The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim '' and I was disappointed when my Laptop couldn't run it. The next day at school I asked my friend why I couldn't run the game and he asked about the specifications of my Laptop. When I turned to him with a blank stare was the moment that changed my understanding of IT.
The next day we were at a computer store buying PC parts with the money I had saved up from my part time job, and in no time we were there building a PC together. The world opened up to me, playing video games, accessing sites I had only heard about, to even just having knowledge at my fingertips. Ever since then I haven't been able to imagine a world without IT, I want to dive deeper into it and further my understanding.
Now I work for an IT company, supporting customers with a specific EDRMS (electronic document and records management system) software called Content Manager, which primarily functions as a repository for electronic documents maintained for record keeping purposes. I came to RMIT to further my career, understands the mechanics in the background of all these systems, from the databases that the documents are catalogued into the Server Administration and management required to keep those services up. RMIT offers that opportunity to further my understanding and further my career.</p>

					<h2> Records Management Officer </h2>
						<p>My ideal job would be a role as a Records Management Officer, eventually aiming to be a Senior Records Manager, where my role would be cataloguing and sentence documentation according to (in Victoria) PROV (Public Record Office Victoria) guidelines.
Ever since I started working on the other side of the fence, on the Support Desk for an application that manages record compliance and the infrastructure surrounding it, I became fascinated by the role. The process of Developing Business Classification Schemes to properly identify and catalogue a company's documentation in accordance to the (RDA) Retention Disposal Authority determined by PROV for that specific type of company has fascinated me. The automation in the backend of various EDRMs softwares that can sentence thousands and in some cases tens of thousands of documents in a day via the organisation, planning and mapping of systems is nothing short of amazing.
The required skills for such a job would be; in depth knowledge of the Record Keeping requirements and the various laws that come with that, a strong knowledge of an EDRMS application and various other applications that work well with it, such as Office 365, Sharepoint etc, and also a strong fundamental knowledge of Database Administration, and how to use Oracle or SQL to store that data safely and securely.
Currently, my experience is highly focused on an EDRMS application Content Manager, where I have in-depth knowledge of how to install, configure, manage and troubleshoot the program with all major releases, and have a strong working relationship with the developers of the application. I am working towards the qualifications required to take that next step here with RMIT.
To facilitate my growth and eventual goal, my plan is to complete my Bachelor of IT, while continuing to work at my current company, networking with various organisations, improving my backend knowledge of Content Manager and improving my knowledge of Database Administration and Record Keeping duties.

						<h2> Myers-Brigss </h2>
							<h3> Assertive Defender (ISFJ-A) </h3>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>This result tells me that I have great analytical abilities and that I am reliable and supportive, but also apparently too altruistic and overloads themselves. This means I should also rely on my team more and not take all the burden onto myself, trusting in my Team and using my strengths to their full advantage.</li>
										<li>These results have given me a great insight into the fact that I can be hesitant to take charge, so already as a first step, I took charge and created a post to organise a team for Assignment 2. I have always preferred completing my tasks as requested and have never been one to take more initiative, however, this is my opportunity to try and take charge.</li>
										<li>I don't think I can see other peoples results prior to organising teams, and most of the time unless you are a Team Leader that has the ability to hire their team, you'll be put into teams without a choice. If I were to hypothetically take this into account when creating a team then I would pick someone who is a natural born leader and is as assertive as I am.</li>
									</ul>
 </p>

						<h2> Learning Style </h2>
							<h3> Pragamatist Style Dominant </h3>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>This test tells me that I am pragmatic and that I learn best via the following tasks:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Practicals</li>
												<li>Case studies</li>
												<li>Problem setting</li>
												<li>Discussions</li>
											</ul>
										<li>This indicates that I should focus on these methods of learning when I am trying to acquire new skills and enhance already existing skills</li>
										<li>In a team setting this indicates that discussion would be a great way for me to learn and understand what the team is trying to accomplish, along with practical examples and past case studies. Using these tools can help further the strengths of the team.</li>
										<li>A team that learns in a similar way to me would be easier to work with, so choing other Pragmatists would be beneficial, however, a strong team is a diverse team, and even if it would be easier, having people with different strengths and weaknesses would be more beneficial.</li>
									</ul>
 </p>
					</article>

						<h2> Leadership Style </h2>
							<h3> Contrarian Leader </h3>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>My leadership style indicates that I have been "liberated from binary thinking" which apparently means I can maintain two conflicting ideas at the same time. If I am being honest this test makes the least sense to me, I must have submitted two opposite ideas in the questions. If I were to take this with a grain of salt and still reflect on this, I would see this as a positive, being able to grasp several opposing concepts and the same time so that I can make an informed decision moving forward</li>
										<li>I don't think this style is suited towards leadership as I "never blindly trust experts and defer decision making if it is reasonable to wait" which seems illogical to me, but I guess accurate since I am not trusting this site, telling me I don't trust the experts. Either way this indicates that this leadership style is indecisive and would be better suited to being delegated smaller more focused teams with already predefined objectives.</li>
										<li>Similar to the other tests, this indicates very strongly that I would need a strong leader in my team, someone who would assertively make those decisions instead of allowing me to ponder the advice of an expert for an extended period of time.</li>
