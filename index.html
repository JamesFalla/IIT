						<p> My name is James Falla. I am 27 years old and currently work for FYB Pty Ltd where I work on the support desk assisting various customers with the application Content Manager. Bonus fun fact, RMIT was a customer at one point in time for FYB which I had assisted with in the past. I grew up in an Italian household, my father moving from Napoli, Italy when he was about 16. As an Italian household, food, family and sport were always important, and I grew up playing tennis until I went to University back in 2013. Originally I went to study Astrophysics at ANU in Canberra, however, due to health issues I had to drop out and return home. </p>
						<p>Interesting Facts:
							<br>After coming home from University I actually worked as a tennis coach for 3 years while doing my pre apprenticeship as an Electrician. After all that I ended up in an IT support job and have loved IT ever since. </p>

					<p> As a kid my parents were big on sports, going outside, we didn't have internet until I was 13 when I needed it for High School. When I was 17 my parents bought me a laptop I could use for school, and of course at that age I bought a video game "The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim" and I was disappointed when my Laptop couldn't run it. <br>The next day at school I asked my friend why I couldn't run the game and he asked about the specifications of my Laptop. When I turned to him with a blank stare was the moment that changed my understanding of IT.
The next day we were at a computer store buying PC parts with the money I had saved up from my part time job, and in no time we were there building a PC together. The world opened up to me, playing video games, accessing sites I had only heard about, to even just having knowledge at my fingertips. Ever since then I haven't been able to imagine a world without IT, I want to dive deeper into it and further my understanding.
<br>Now I work for an IT company, supporting customers with a specific EDRMS (electronic document and records management system) software called Content Manager, which primarily functions as a repository for electronic documents maintained for record keeping purposes. I came to RMIT to further my career, understands the mechanics in the background of all these systems, from the databases that the documents are catalogued into the Server Administration and management required to keep those services up. RMIT offers that opportunity to further my understanding and further my career.</p>

						<p>My ideal job would be a role as a Records Management Officer, eventually aiming to be a Senior Records Manager, where my role would be cataloguing and sentence documentation according to (in Victoria) PROV (Public Record Office Victoria) guidelines.
Ever since I started working on the other side of the fence, on the Support Desk for an application that manages record compliance and the infrastructure surrounding it, I became fascinated by the role. The process of Developing Business Classification Schemes to properly identify and catalogue a company's documentation in accordance to the (RDA) Retention Disposal Authority determined by PROV for that specific type of company has fascinated me. The automation in the backend of various EDRMs softwares that can sentence thousands and in some cases tens of thousands of documents in a day via the organisation, planning and mapping of systems is nothing short of amazing.
The required skills for such a job would be; in depth knowledge of the Record Keeping requirements and the various laws that come with that, a strong knowledge of an EDRMS application and various other applications that work well with it, such as Office 365, Sharepoint etc, and also a strong fundamental knowledge of Database Administration, and how to use Oracle or SQL to store that data safely and securely.
Currently, my experience is highly focused on an EDRMS application Content Manager, where I have in-depth knowledge of how to install, configure, manage and troubleshoot the program with all major releases, and have a strong working relationship with the developers of the application. I am working towards the qualifications required to take that next step here with RMIT.
To facilitate my growth and eventual goal, my plan is to complete my Bachelor of IT, while continuing to work at my current company, networking with various organisations, improving my backend knowledge of Content Manager and improving my knowledge of Database Administration and Record Keeping duties.

									<ul>
										<li>This result tells me that I have great analytical abilities and that I am reliable and supportive, but also apparently too altruistic and overloads themselves. This means I should also rely on my team more and not take all the burden onto myself, trusting in my Team and using my strengths to their full advantage.</li>
										<li>These results have given me a great insight into the fact that I can be hesitant to take charge, so already as a first step, I took charge and created a post to organise a team for Assignment 2. I have always preferred completing my tasks as requested and have never been one to take more initiative, however, this is my opportunity to try and take charge.</li>
										<li>I don't think I can see other peoples results prior to organising teams, and most of the time unless you are a Team Leader that has the ability to hire their team, you'll be put into teams without a choice. If I were to hypothetically take this into account when creating a team then I would pick someone who is a natural born leader and is as assertive as I am.</li>

								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>This test tells me that I am pragmatic and that I learn best via the following tasks:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Practicals</li>
												<li>Case studies</li>
												<li>Problem setting</li>
												<li>Discussions</li>
											</ul>
										<li>This indicates that I should focus on these methods of learning when I am trying to acquire new skills and enhance already existing skills</li>
										<li>In a team setting this indicates that discussion would be a great way for me to learn and understand what the team is trying to accomplish, along with practical examples and past case studies. Using these tools can help further the strengths of the team.</li>
										<li>A team that learns in a similar way to me would be easier to work with, so choing other Pragmatists would be beneficial, however, a strong team is a diverse team, and even if it would be easier, having people with different strengths and weaknesses would be more beneficial.</li>

								</div>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>My leadership style indicates that I have been "liberated from binary thinking" which apparently means I can maintain two conflicting ideas at the same time. If I am being honest this test makes the least sense to me, I must have submitted two opposite ideas in the questions. If I were to take this with a grain of salt and still reflect on this, I would see this as a positive, being able to grasp several opposing concepts and the same time so that I can make an informed decision moving forward</li>
										<li>I don't think this style is suited towards leadership as I "never blindly trust experts and defer decision making if it is reasonable to wait" which seems illogical to me, but I guess accurate since I am not trusting this site, telling me I don't trust the experts. Either way this indicates that this leadership style is indecisive and would be better suited to being delegated smaller more focused teams with already predefined objectives.</li>
										<li>Similar to the other tests, this indicates very strongly that I would need a strong leader in my team, someone who would assertively make those decisions instead of allowing me to ponder the advice of an expert for an extended period of time.</li>

		<div class="sectionTitle"><h1> Project </h1></div>
			<div class="sectionCotnent">
			<article>
				<h2> Overview</h2>
					<p> An already saturated market, would be the colour detection apps, an app that you can point your camera at and the app will tell you what that colour is, but those apps don’t go far enough in realising what those apps could accomplish. The app I would propose developing would be one that can detect the colours, identify their Hexadecimal code but then integrate with a company who for example produces paint. So you’d point your camera, find out the colour is Red, then have the option to browse the various red paints available. </p>
				<h2> Motivation</h2>
					<p> Now, identifying that something is red seems pretty simple, so where’s the market, well that would be the model painting hobbyists. Games Workshop, a company that creates miniatures and has partnerships with Citadel paint, is a growing company. Just in the year 2021 their revenue was 353.2 Million GBP (They are a British owned company). This is up from 269.7 Million GBP just a year ago and 123.5 Million GBP back in 2014. With celebrities like Henry Cavil openly discussing the hobby and the surge of people picking up the hobby during lockdown, there is now a larger market of new people to the hobby. So developing an app that could be pointed at a model, identify the colours and be advised which paints were used would greatly benefit the new to the market hobbyists. </p>
				<h2> Description</h2>
					<p> To make this project work there are a few requirements that would need to be met, which are predominantly; developing a working app that can detect colour, using that identified colour to associate with an appropriate paint colour, and an understanding of the technical requirements of the phone device’s camera to get the appropriate quality. 

An app that can detect colour is possible, there are several apps already on the market capable of this, and researching online I have found articles that indicate it’s possible to code such a feature in python. However, it seems that most apps are developed in the following code languages:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Swift</li>
					<li>HTML5</li>
					<li>C#<li>
					<li>C++<li>
					<li>Java<li>
					<p>Once the most appropriate coding language for developing the app has been identified, the next requirement would be developing the app which we would need to consider. Where are we releasing the app to, Android or IOS or maybe both? This decision may be determined during the project once we understand the scope of development, how easy is it to port our code to the relevant platforms and what development tools are available for those platforms. Lastly, during the development process we will need to create a specification guide, as the app relies on hardware, specifically a camera that would need to be of a sufficient quality with regards to its Mega Pixels, to get an accurate result when using the application.

Once the app has been developed, we don’t have the rights to use a company's paints as a reference, so the goal would be either to sell the developed app to an appropriate company or enter talks to have a partnership with the company. A partnership could come in exclusive rights to only having their paints advertised via the app upon colour recognition, or maybe even integrate directly into their own website store front, with options to check out and purchase directly from the app.

If the scope of the project increases, it may even be possible to add further functionality, such as, colour gradient, so if a colour blends from one shade to another, being able to identify that and explain the colour gradient via the Hexadecimal codes and the paint that could accomplish that. There doesn’t seem to be any app on the market that can accomplish this so it may be a difficult task to implement, but would be a valuable avenue to investigate, and potentially include in future updates.

Given that this is a University project, realistically the most likely option would be selling the rights to the developed app to a company after showing the proof of concept, as an Independent team led by me would not have the resources to develop the app in a timely manner while completing its development with the promised functionality and ongoing updates.
 </p>
				<h2> Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p> The main tools and technology required to develop the app would be a tool to write our code in, for example Javascript can be used to develop both Android and IOS so a program like React Native would be the perfect tool to develop the code for our app if we were to go down the Javascript path.Another viable option would be to use the free Android Studio development tool which can be used to develop Android apps natively using the Android SDK. Currently for a proof of concept, The Android Studio tool would be best to use as it still uses Javascript that can be ported into another tool in the future if we want to port the app for IOS. Along with that Android Studio has various tools including Fast Emulation and an intuitive code editor that can be used. </p>
				<h2> Skills Required</h2>
					<p> Primarily, the main skills required would be to learn Javascript via the Android Studio tool which there are plenty of resources online to acquire and develop those skills in Javascript. Beyond that, the other skills required would be looking into potential web integration within the app for at least a proof of concept of the ability to link the result to the a web page for the purpose of purchasing the paint, with the proof of concept used to either gain the rights to link to the company’s respective shop front or to sell the app with that functionality already available. </p>
				<h2> Outcome</h2>
					<p> At the conclusion of the project success would be developing a proof of concept app, capable of detecting a range of colours, under various lighting conditions and various camera specifications. Then have those identified colours associated with the respective paint. This will allow users an intuitive tool to improve their painting skills by analysing completed painted models and knowing exactly which paints they should buy to complete their project.  </p>
